Hi Julie! I thought it would be useful for you to have a site to visit to remember how great you are! Reload the page
for more reasons :)

<script language="JavaScript">

    var julie = [
    'You made the department magazine practically on your own! In second year!!!',
    'You got the highest mark out of over 100 people!',
    'You are so good at skiing you teach other people how to do it!',
    '
    
    
    ];
    var i = Math.floor(julie.length*Math.random())

    document.write(julie[i]);
